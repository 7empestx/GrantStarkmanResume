## Experience

## JT4 LLC Las Vegas Nevada
ELECTRONICS TECHNICIAN II\
November 2019 - Present
- **Instrumentation Installation:** Lead the implementations of real time Unix based data processing environments that receive UDP and
    TCP/IP network traffic from up to 15 unique Ethernet servers; delivered data processing phases to customers 6 months ahead of schedule
- **Network Administration:** Securely installed and configured Linux and Microsoft Windows development and networking environments
    for up to 30 professionals to scope, design, build, and deploy their projects with ease; deployed 10 development environments within
    8 hours
- **Troubleshooting:** Interrogated hardware, software, and networks by analyzing signals with an Oscilloscope, collecting data with Wire-
    shark, or using networking tools such as ping and ifconfig to understand the health of the network and restore systems to an operational
    state; restored a system that was relied on by 5 other systems within 2 minutes during a time critical event

## College of Southern Nevada Las Vegas Nevada
TEACHING ASSISTANT: INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE I & II\
August 2020 - December 2020
- **Teaching C++ & Linux:** Mentored and guided up to 50 students through computer science curriculum by demonstrating many useful
    development and debugging tools such as Windows Subsystem for Linux, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, and the GDB debugger.
- **Virtual Learning Implementation:** Introduced and instructed on the use of Discord as a virtual learning environment to computer
    science faculty and hundreds of computing information technology students thus improving faculty communication and student out-
    come

## Projects

### xv6 Implementations | Unix Kernel, Qemu, C, Perl, ASM, Makefile
- Virtualized an ARM based open source Unix kernel using Qemu on Windows Subsystem for Linux and implemented several kernel and
    user space functionalities such as memory management, process scheduling, and file system functionality while also improving the
    average wait time for high priority processes in the ready queue 2 fold by implementing a priority based scheduling algorithm

### Data Parallelism with pthread | Linux, C, pthread, mutex, Multi-threading
- Implemented data parallelism using pthread to compute the solution to a 𝑂(𝑛√𝑛)problem with an𝑛input as large as 10,000, thus bringing the overall compute time from infinity with 1 thread to just 2 seconds with 4 threads

### Wedding Website| Javascript, HTML, CSS, AWS
- Designed an elegant website for my wedding using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and implemented hosting for the website with a custom
    Route 53 domain using an AWS EC2 instance while implementing 3 additional features that traditional wedding websites did not offer
